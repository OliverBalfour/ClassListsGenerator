# Class Lists App

Generate lists of students for school classes given certain constraints.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). See documentation [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started). See default README [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/cra-template/template/README.md).

## Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
